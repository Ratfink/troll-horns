The big list
============

* Make a script to automatically make STL files
* Two screws per horn option for people who have lots of hardware and don't
  like aligning things manually (me)
* Add features to make some horns possible
    * Some will require rotated disks (e.g. Aradia and Tavros)
    * Others will need basically several horn defs (e.g. Vriska and Sollux)
    * Left and right for asymmetrical horns (e.g. Equius and Kanaya)
* Add more horns
* Add small grooves where colors change for easier masking/painting
